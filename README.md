# Scooter Trader API

## What this is: 
Practicing using MongoDB and integrating with Node and Express to create a simple scooter listings api that a client side app would communicate with to get, add, and delete scooter listings on a scooter for sale site. I plan on building this out much more but its a nice reference point for a super simple API setup using MongoDB as the database. 

### Tech used: 
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Express
